- Archetype: maven-archetype-webapp (version 1.0)
- Group Id: This will your package name (com.springmvc)
- ArtifactId: This will be your Project name
- Click on Create

Step 2: Setting Maven(or Gradle):

- In Intellij, Go to top right corner -> Click Settings
- Search for maven or gradle
- Set these:
    Gradle User Home: All dependencies will be downloaded here
    Gradle Distribution: Choose your gradle-8.1 installed in local
    Gradle JVM: Select the JDK 17
- Give OK 
- Gradle build will start and dependencies will be downloaded
- You should get Build successful

Step 3: Install Tomcat

    Server port: 8080
    Admin port: 8006(to avoid conflict)
